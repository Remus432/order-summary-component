# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Today's challenge was building the Order Summary Component. It's a fun challenge to test your CSS layout skills and eye for design.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Svelte
* GSAP (for animations)

## Development

The exciting part about these challenges that don't have too many requirements is that you can add in little touches to the design and make it nicer. 

I found this challenge a great opportunity to practice some more GSAP since I'm not yet completely comfortable using it in my projects and I still turn to CSS for most of the animations I do in my projects.

This is also the first time I've done a project using Svelte which is an awesome compiler. I discovered about it thanks to a great frontend developer called [ApplePieGiraffe](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ApplePieGiraffe)

I'll be trying out Svelte in further projects as well to witness more of its potential in developing rapid websites / web apps.

The only Javascript used in this project was for importing GSAP and the onMount hook. Other than that, this project was HTML / CSS intensive.

The design was fun and interesting and coding it was the same. 

Overall, another enjoyable challenge from Frontend Mentor! ;)
